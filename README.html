<p>WordPress + BuddyPress + BBPress Theme</p>
<h2 id="about-this-theme">About this theme</h2>
<p>Surface is a theme wrangled for WordPress, BuddyPress and maybe in the future BBPress.</p>
<p>It has some simple but powerful configurations available to site administrators and has been designed with content in mind.</p>
<h2 id="what-works-and-what-doesn-t-">What works and what doesn&#39;t?</h2>
<h3 id="works">Works</h3>
<p>WordPress Posts, WordPress Pages, WordPress Customizer, BuddyPress Activity, BuddyPress Directories, BuddyPress Members Component, 
BuddyPress Groups Component, BuddyPress Registration, BuddyPress Activation.</p>
<h3 id="in-progress">In Progress</h3>
<p>Sidebar needs some work</p>
<h2 id="responsiveness">Responsiveness</h2>
<p>I&#39;ve tried hard to make this theme responsive which is a large undertaking for a theme of this nature. Largely it&#39;s a successful attempt but there are some bits and pieces
that are probelmatic and inconsistent e.g image sizes in IE.</p>
<h2 id="why-put-an-unfinished-theme-live-">Why put an unfinished theme live?</h2>
<p>It&#39;s almost finished, I&#39;ve been spending a lot of time with BuddyPress for 2 months now and have learned a lot. That said, this is a solid theme for the most part and only needs a small amount
of TLC to get started with a community.</p>
<h2 id="will-you-work-on-this-if-i-pay-you-">Will you work on this if I pay you?</h2>
<p>Of course.</p>
<h2 id="will-you-work-on-this-even-if-i-don-t-pay-you-">Will you work on this even if I don&#39;t pay you?</h2>
<p>The users will shape the development of this master branch, I do help people on the BuddyPress.org/support forums. So yes, I will help you there for free or on BuddyCore.com</p>
