# surface-theme
WordPress + BuddyPress + BBPress Theme

## About this theme
Surface is a theme wrangled for WordPress, BuddyPress and maybe in the future BBPress.

It has some simple but powerful configurations available to site administrators and has been designed with content in mind.

## What works and what doesn't?

### Works
WordPress Posts, WordPress Pages, WordPress Customizer, BuddyPress Activity, BuddyPress Directories, BuddyPress Members Component, 
BuddyPress Groups Component, BuddyPress Registration, BuddyPress Activation.

### In Progress
Sidebar needs some work

## Responsiveness
I've tried hard to make this theme responsive which is a large undertaking for a theme of this nature. Largely it's a successful attempt but there are some bits and pieces
that are probelmatic and inconsistent e.g image sizes in IE.

## Why put an unfinished theme live?
It's almost finished, I've been spending a lot of time with BuddyPress for 2 months now and have learned a lot. That said, this is a solid theme for the most part and only needs a small amount
of TLC to get started with a community.

## Will you work on this if I pay you?
Of course.

## Will you work on this even if I don't pay you?
The users will shape the development of this master branch, I do help people on the BuddyPress.org/support forums. So yes, I will help you there for free or on BuddyCore.com
